# Welcome to the final week of the bootcamp.
You will write all your code inside the Final Project Directory along with the readme file and requirements files.

Your final project can be anything that you want to make. Be sure to use the techniques that you have learnt in the previous
three weeks. You will have to fill this (form)[#] once you completed the project to tell us more about it. Mentors and judges will
judge your final project on the following basis:
1. Code Readibility
2. Code Efficiency
3. Project's Error handling and User Interaction
4. Simplicity of project and problem statement.
